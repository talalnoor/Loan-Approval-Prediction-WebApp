A full-stack machine learning web application that predicts loan approval decisions in real time. Users fill out a loan application form in the browser, and a tuned Random Forest model — trained on a real-world messy dataset — returns an instant prediction with a confidence score.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project takes a complete ML pipeline (data cleaning → EDA → feature engineering → model training → tuning) and deploys it as an interactive web application using Flask. It's designed to demonstrate the full journey from raw data to a usable, production-style product — not just a notebook.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Task** | Binary classification — Approved vs Rejected, served via a live web form |
| **Dataset size** | 6,120 loan applications, 23 raw columns |
| **Final model** | Random Forest (tuned via GridSearchCV) |
| **Final performance** | **96.16% accuracy · 0.975 F1** |
| **Stack** | Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, HTML/CSS/JS |

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive prediction form** — 18 input fields covering personal, employment, and financial details
- **Real-time ML prediction** — trained Random Forest model runs inference on submission
- **Confidence scoring** — shows the model's probability for both Approved and Rejected outcomes, not just a hard yes/no
- **Responsive design** — fully usable on mobile and desktop
- **Client-side + server-side validation** — form checks required fields before submission, and Flask handles bad input gracefully with error messages instead of crashing
- **Application summary** — result page recaps key applicant details alongside the prediction

## 🧹 The Machine Learning Pipeline

### Data Cleaning
The raw dataset was intentionally messy: inconsistent text casing (`M`/`Male`/`male`/`MALE`), a whitespace-corrupted numeric column (`credit_score` stored as `' 764.0'`), a fully empty column, a duplicate index column, and junk free-text — all standardized and cleaned.

### EDA Findings
Demographic features (gender, marital status, education, property area) showed almost no effect on approval — rates stayed within 1–3 points of the 76.8% baseline. Credit score, however, showed a strong effect:

| Credit Band | Approval Rate |
|---|---|
| Poor | 64.8% |
| Fair | 73.7% |
| Good | 90.8% |
| Excellent | 91.7% |

### Feature Engineering
Five engineered features were added: `debt_to_income`, `total_assets`, `asset_to_loan_ratio`, `expense_ratio`, and `credit_score_band`. Three of these ranked in the model's top 6 most important features — outperforming several raw columns.

### Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | 83.4% | 0.932 | 0.846 | 0.887 |
| Decision Tree | 95.0% | 0.972 | 0.963 | 0.967 |
| **Random Forest (tuned)** | **96.2%** | **0.975** | **0.976** | **0.975** |

Hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV` (5-fold CV) improved F1 from 0.968 → 0.975.

**Top features by importance:** `debt_to_income` (engineered), `income_annual`, `monthly_income` (engineered), `credit_score`, `existing_loans`, `expense_ratio` (engineered).
